## ✨ Features

* **Instant Gameplay:** Click the refresh button to instantly generate a new number.
* **Dynamic UI:** Background color and icons change dynamically based on the result.
    * 🟢 **Green Theme:** Displays when you hit the Lucky Number 7.
    * 🔴 **Red Theme:** Displays when you miss the number.
* **Clean Interface:** Minimalist design with clear feedback.

## 📱 How It Works

1.  The app sets a **Target Lucky Number** (which is 7).
2.  The user taps the **Refresh Button** (bottom right).
3.  The app generates a random number between 0 and 10.
4.  **Logic:**
    * `If (number == 7)` -> **YOU WIN!** (Trophy Icon 🏆)
    * `If (number != 7)` -> **YOU LOSE!** (Sad Face Icon ☹️)
